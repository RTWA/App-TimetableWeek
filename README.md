## About WebApps - Staff Directory

Staff Directory is an App for [WebApps](https://getwebapps.uk). Once installed, it can display a grid of Staff Photos and their details, or the details can be displayed in a table with customisable fields.

Staff Directory can can synchronise with Mircosoft Azure Active Directory to retrieve selected groups of people and create records for them.

WebApps Users can build a view, filtered by a department, or other field. Views have a few different options for their layout and who is allowed to view them (Administrators can always see all views).
Each view then outputs a unique `<iframe />` code, ready to be embedded into your WordPress site, VLE or SharePoint page.
